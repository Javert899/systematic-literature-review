Recently, speculative and critical design approaches have reflectively explored and questioned possible, and preferable futures in HCI research. We propose a complementary concept \u2013 material speculation \u2013 that utilizes actual and situated design artifacts in the everyday as a site of critical inquiry. We see the literary theory of possible worlds and the related concept of the counterfactual as informative to this work. We present five examples of interaction design artifacts that can be viewed as material speculations. We conclude with a discussion of characteristics of material speculations and their implications for future design-oriented research.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7146\/aahcc.v1i1.21299","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,14]],"date-time":"2015-10-14T11:43:29Z","timestamp":1444823009000},"page":"12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":30,"title":["Material Speculation: Actual Artifacts for Critical Inquiry"],"prefix":"10.7146","volume":"1","author":[{"given":"Ron","family":"Wakkary","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"William","family":"Odom","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sabrina","family":"Hauser","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Garnet","family":"Hertz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Henry","family":"Lin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"4226","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,5]]},"container-title":["Aarhus Series on Human Centered Computing"],"original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk\/index.php\/lexn\/article\/viewFile\/21299\/18773","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,6]],"date-time":"2017-07-06T16:17:07Z","timestamp":1499357827000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,5]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,5]]},"issue":"1"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7146\/aahcc.v1i1.21299","relation":{},"ISSN":["2445-7221"],"issn-type":[{"value":"2445-7221","type":"electronic"}]}}
