The authors' work captures the knowledge of existing approaches and tools in converting the data from transaction logs to event logs for process mining techniques. They conduct a detailed analysis of the artifact-centric approach concepts and describe its constructs by the ontological metamodel. The underlying logical and semantically rich structure of the approach is presented through the model definition. The paper specifies how concepts of the data source are mapped onto the concept of the event log. Dynamics NAV ERP system is used as an example to illustrate the data-oriented structure of ERP system.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/ijdsst.2016040102","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,20]],"date-time":"2016-06-20T19:14:08Z","timestamp":1466450048000},"page":"18-28","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Metamodel of the Artifact-Centric Approach to Event Log Extraction from ERP Systems"],"prefix":"10.4018","volume":"8","author":[{"given":"Ana","family":"Paji\u0107","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia,"}]},{"given":"Dragana","family":"Be\u010dejski-Vujaklija","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"}]}],"member":"2432","container-title":["International Journal of Decision Support System Technology"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.igi-global.com\/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=157363","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,13]],"date-time":"2018-11-13T08:39:11Z","timestamp":1542098351000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[""],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4018\/ijdsst.2016040102","relation":{},"ISSN":["1941-6296","1941-630X"],"issn-type":[{"value":"1941-6296","type":"print"},{"value":"1941-630X","type":"electronic"}]}}
