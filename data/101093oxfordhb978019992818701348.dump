These artistic and aesthetic forms increasingly operate with physical, theatrical, and choreographic practices and tools, developing a politics of images in an effective and affective media environment. This chapter discusses, using the examples of LIGNA\u2019s performances Radioballet and Dance of All, the aesthetic, political, and social dimensions of artistic interventions based on a concept of community that is defined by corporeal and aesthetic practices. The chapter highlights the political potential implied in the aesthetic and artistic forms of public cultural gatherings. It focuses on the production of attention by means of bodily practices (gestures, facial expressions, movement, dance), theatrical settings (stage, costumes, music), and choreographic tools (organization of bodies, rhythm, dramaturgy).<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oxfordhb\/9780199928187.013.48","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,7]],"date-time":"2017-02-07T15:21:29Z","timestamp":1486480889000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Urban Choreographies"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Gabriele","family":"Klein","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","container-title":["Oxford Handbooks Online"],"original-title":["Urban Choreographies"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,7]],"date-time":"2017-02-07T15:21:29Z","timestamp":1486480889000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"editor":[{"given":"Rebekah J.","family":"Kowal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gerald","family":"Siegmund","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Randy","family":"Martin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,6]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/oxfordhb\/9780199928187.013.48","relation":{}}}
