Over the last two decades, the artifact-centric approach for business process management has been evidenced to have higher level of flexibility. However, the adaptation of a model of an artifact-centric business process instance is still inevitable and pervasive due to the complex and ever-changing business environments. Almost all works of artifact-centric business process neglect this issue. To fill this gap, we propose a special business rule called adaptation rule to address the dynamic adaptation problem and describe the adaptation by a global adaptation model. Moreover, we provide a validation mechanism over our proposed adaptation rule of the global adaptation model to guarantee the behavior correctness of the adaptation. Through this validation approach, computing the lifecycle of the global adaptation model can be avoided.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/info10020057","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,12]],"date-time":"2019-02-12T08:18:20Z","timestamp":1549959500000},"page":"57","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Adaptation of a Model of an Artifact-Centric Business Process Instance and Its Validation"],"prefix":"10.3390","volume":"10","author":[{"given":"Junbao","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Guohua","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,11]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref1","DOI":"10.1016\/j.datak.2004.01.002","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"ref2","DOI":"10.1109\/TSMC.2016.2591538","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"ref3","first-page":"3","article-title":"Business artifacts: A data-centric approach to modeling business operations and processes","volume":"32","author":"Cohn","year":"2009","journal-title":"IEEE Data Eng.
